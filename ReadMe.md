# Bike Sharing Statistical Analysis

## About
<ul>

In this project, I am using Python to explore data on bike share systems for three major cities in the US - Chicago, New York, and Washington. I wrote code to import data and answer interesting questions about it by calculating descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes raw input to create an interactive in-device experience to present these stats.
</ul>


## Data
 - Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
 - End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
 - Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
 - Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
 - End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
 - User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
   - Gender
   - Birth Year


## Statistics required

**Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)**
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

    ----------------------------------------------
**Popular stations and trip**
- most common start station 
- most common end station 
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station) 

    ---------------------------------------------
**Trip duration**
- total travel time
- average travel time

    ---------------------------------------------
**User info**

- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

    ---------------------------------------------
**display this statistics with visuals**

- Bar chart for 
    - Hours count
    - Months count
    - Days count
    - Start stations count
    - End stations count

- Pie chart for 
    - Usre types
    - Genders

- Hist for 
    - Birthdays
